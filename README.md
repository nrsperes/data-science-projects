## Data Science Projects

This is a repository for Data Science and Machine Learning projects that I have developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The projects are from courses that I took on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) — see below — or from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

- [Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
